Program Name: lab02jpp.cpp (attached to email)
Sample Output: lab02jppOutPut.txt (attached to email)

Program Purpose: This program finds all the prime factors of all #'s between 1-1000
		 it then writes all of the factors to a file that user created in the 
		 program.

Program Testing: I tested my program on Clst, as well as CodeBlocks MinGW
		 (attached to email)

Problems: The program didn't cover any new material so the syntax wasn't a big issue,
	  however the logic took a bit longer than expected espeically with trying to 
	  make the sample output work out.

Time Spent: 4 Hours with planning
